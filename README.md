## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time. It enables users to track and manage modifications, collaborate with others, and go back to previous states if needed. Git is an example of a version control system.

## Git vs GitHub

Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. Git is used for local version control, while GitHub allows you to collaborate and share your Git repositories with others over the internet. Git and Github work hand in hand to ensure ease and efficiency

## GitHub Alternatives

GitHub alternatives, that offer similar version control and collaboration features include:
1. GitLab
2. SourceForge
3. Bitbucket

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull

- `git fetch`: Fetches changes from a remote repository but does not automatically merge them into your working branch. It updates your local repository's references to the remote.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your current branch.

## Git Rebase

`git rebase` is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another. It rewrites commit history to produce a more linear project history. The command is:
git rebase <branch_name>.

## Git Cherry-pick
git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It's useful for selectively adding changes. The command is: 
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
